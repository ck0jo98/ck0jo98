### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jovan Sremacki, a passionate software engineer with 4 years of hands-on experience in the dynamic world of web development. My journey has primarily revolved around the Ruby ecosystem, with a deep focus on Ruby itself and the powerful Ruby on Rails framework. Currently, I am enthusiastically expanding my horizons by diving into the fascinating realm of the Hanami framework.

What truly captivates me about Ruby is its metaprogramming capabilities. I'm constantly drawn to exploring the intricate art of leveraging Ruby's metaprogramming features to write elegant and expressive code. It's a journey that has not only sharpened my technical skills but has also enriched my understanding of software design principles.

As an unwavering advocate of Test-Driven Development (TDD), I firmly believe that well-tested code breeds confidence and stability. With every line of code I write, I strive to craft comprehensive test suites that ensure the reliability and maintainability of the applications I develop.

In my pursuit of excellence, I also embrace the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), understanding the importance of building software that aligns closely with real-world business domains. By following DDD principles, I aim to create scalable and maintainable architectures that empower businesses to flourish.

Beyond Ruby, I've ventured into the realms of React and Node.js, exploring the front-end and back-end landscapes to build robust and performant applications across the full stack. This diverse exposure has broadened my skill set and fostered a holistic approach to problem-solving.

In a rapidly evolving industry, I remain committed to continuous learning and growth. I actively seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge, whether it's mastering new technologies, staying up to date with best practices, or exploring emerging trends like microservice architectures.
