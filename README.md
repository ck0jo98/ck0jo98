Software Engineer
-----------------

As a software engineer with four years of experience, my journey in web development has been deeply rooted in the Ruby ecosystem, primarily with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

What truly excites me about Ruby is its metaprogramming capabilities, allowing me to craft code that is not just functional but also elegantly expressive. This experience has sharpened my technical acumen and given me a profound understanding of software design principles.

I‚Äôm a staunch proponent of Test-Driven Development (TDD). My belief is that well-tested code isn‚Äôt just about preventing bugs; it‚Äôs the cornerstone of building reliable and stable software. This approach has been integral to my practice, ensuring the applications I develop meet the highest standards of quality.

Additionally, my interest in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) aligns closely with the principles of developing software that mirrors real-world business scenarios. This philosophy has been crucial in guiding me to design scalable and maintainable systems, which I see as essential for any business-driven technology, especially in dynamic fields like blockchain and web3.

While my primary experience has been with Ruby, my fascination with the evolving landscape of blockchain technology has led me to start venturing into Solidity and web3 spaces. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to diverse interactions across wallets, dApps, and blockchains.
